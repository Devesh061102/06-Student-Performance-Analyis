# Student Performance Analysis and Prediction

## Roadmap

**Objective**: The main objective of this project is to analyze various factors influencing student performance and develop predictive models to forecast future student performance based on these factors.

**Data Collection**: The project starts with collecting a dataset of student performance. 

**Dataset**: The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977). It includes information on gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, test preparation, and scores in math, reading, and writing for 1000 students.

**Preprocessing**: 
- Inspecting data for missing values and duplicates
- Cleaning data and converting data types as necessary
- Descriptive statistics and initial visualizations

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
- Distribution analysis of scores in math, reading, and writing
- Analyzing relationships between different features and scores
- Correlation heatmap to identify significant correlations

**Model Training**:
- Data Preparation: Splitting the dataset into features (X) and target variables (y), encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical variables
- Model Selection: Training and evaluating multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), CatBoost Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor
- Model Evaluation: Using metrics like R2 score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance

**Evaluation**: The models are evaluated based on their predictive performance, and the best-performing model is selected for deployment.

**Model Deployment**: The best-performing model can be deployed using Flask, a lightweight web server gateway interface (WSGI) web application framework. This allows the model to be accessed via a simple web interface, enabling real-time predictions.

Overall, this project aims to provide insights into factors affecting student performance and develop robust predictive models to aid in educational planning and intervention strategies.

## Lessons Learned

This project provided a valuable opportunity to apply data science concepts to a practical problem. Key lessons learned include:
- The importance of data cleaning and preprocessing in ensuring accurate analysis
- How to use various regression models and evaluate their performance
- The critical role of feature engineering in improving model accuracy
- Insights into the factors that influence student performance

Iâ€™m excited about the potential applications of this project and look forward to exploring more ways to leverage data science in the field of education. ðŸ’¡
